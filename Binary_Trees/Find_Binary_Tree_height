'''the height of the tree is the longest path from the root node to the leaf
node. So I created a height function in the node class that returns the max()
number of nodes (either on the left or right of the root). I also decided to
check if the tree is balanced, so there is an is_balanced() function to compare
the heights of the left and right subtrees.
