'''The breath-first taversal, or level-order traversal is when the traversal
visits all the nodes level by level, from left to right. The queue makes the
navegation easier because of its FIFO property. Which means the output will be
in the saeme order as the keys are inserted.

The python library "collections" has a deque function which will be useful in
this instance to create a queue. I will first set it to root and then call it
on the node as needed.
